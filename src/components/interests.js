                        <p>When I'm not at work, you can find me on the soccer field, getting outdoors with my dog Chelsea, or enjoying a cup of tea with my favorite soccer club (Chelsea FC) on the TV.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Despite coming into Landscaping with some very basic knowledge, I've gained a great amount of new knowledge about how to properly take care of plants and trees, learned how to use some heavy machinery, and to really put my attention to detail to the test to make sure what I've done is exactly what I'd want as a customer.</p>
                        <p>I believe that this job has taught me a lot about paying attention to the finite details, and putting my best into a job to make sure the customer is happy with what they get. This is something I'm confident I can bring into any workplace.</p>
